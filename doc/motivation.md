This dashboard represents a first step in the building of an applied 
predictive model. Before you can start building a predictive model, you 
have to get a feeling for the data that is in front of you. How many samples you have,
the dimensionality of the data, how the different variables (features) are distributed,
whether they are skewed or if there are outliers in your data, that might be
problematic for models that are sensitive to it.
