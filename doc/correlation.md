The Correlation tab includes two basic correlation visualizations. On the left side the selected multivariate features are plotted against each other in a Pairs plot. 

- The lower diagonal matrix shows a pairwise loess fit of each pair of features. 
- The upper diagonal matrix shows the Pearson correlation of each pair of features.
- The diagonal shows a histogram describing the respective feature distribution.
