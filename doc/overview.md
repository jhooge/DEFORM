The Overview tab gives a brief visual overview on how features are distributed in the feature matrix. The visualizations are divided in a univariate point of view, which includes a QQ-Plot and a dynamic histogram of the selected univariate feature and a multivariate view on the skewness of the selected multivariate features. As a rule of thumb for building an applied predictive model, skewness should be distributed within -2 and 2 for all features.
