## Data Exploration for Modeling

This repository contains code for an exploratory shiny dashboard for the 
exploration of datasets to be utilized in applied predictive modeling.  

Before you can start building a predictive model, you have to get a feeling for the 
data that is in front of you. How many samples you have,
the dimensionality of the data, how the different variables (features) are distributed,
whether they are skewed or if there are outliers in your data, that might be
problematic for models that are sensitive to it.

This dashboard gives a brief insight into all these potential problematic characteristics of an input dataset.
